# 👋 Hello World!

### 👨‍💻 About Me  
I'm **Alexandre Magalhães** from **Brazil 🇧🇷** — an **Electronic Engineer** passionate about technology, coding, and innovation.  

I develop in **C** for microcontrollers such as **ESP32**, **PIC**, **ARM LPC/STM**, and write **VHDL** for **Altera/Intel FPGAs**.  
I’m always eager to learn new technologies — and yes, losing a few hours of sleep while coding is part of the fun!
